Background
----------

The SchemaSpy Extension is extending the metadata published by he excellent SchemaSpy tool http://schemaspy.org/

It allows the metadata to be extended so that the published data :-

* Provide metadata for CSV files which can be queried by JDBC drivers but have no column size or type information

* Extend the RDBMS metadata for industry standards such as Oracle, DB2, MS SQL Server to lineage data or classify columns for privacy
