Background
----------

The SchemaSpy Extension can extend the metadata published by the excellent SchemaSpy tool http://schemaspy.org/

The extension can improve the metadata so that the published data :-

* Provide metadata for CSV files which can be queried by JDBC drivers but have no column size or type information

* Extend the RDBMS metadata for industry standards such as Oracle, DB2, MS SQL Server to lineage data or classify columns for privacy

* Provide business meaning behin tables and columns for reporting and analytics

* Provide review tracking for schemas, tables, columns

* Include database schema versioning on documentation
